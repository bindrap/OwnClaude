In a dark and twisted Bikini Bottom, Plankton finally succeeded in stealing the Krabby Patty formula. With his newfound power, he replaced Mr. Krabs as the owner of the Krusty Krab. SpongeBob and Squidward were forced to work for Plankton, serving up his disgusting 'Plankton Burgers' to the citizens of Bikini Bottom. Patrick Star, once a loyal friend to SpongeBob, was seduced by Plankton's promise of endless free food and became his loyal sidekick. As the days passed, Bikini Bottom became a shadow of its former self, trapped in a never-ending cycle of greasy despair.
